Iâ€™m an applied scientist at Amazon, building large language models to enhance the shopping experience. Before joining Amazon, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2022, advised by Alice Oh. During my Ph.D., I interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon and as a Research Scientist at Adobe.
